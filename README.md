# Photo-library
Photo library web application designed in Apache Netbeans 2.0 using Glassfish Server 2.0 as part of my Web Applications uni course.

For this course we had to create a photo library with search, list and delete functionalities in two different ways: once with JSPs and servlets,
and a second time with a REST approach.
